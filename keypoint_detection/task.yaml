task_description:
  type: Keypoint detection
  description: |
    Given an image, this task aims to detect the keypoints of the image.
    The model will return a list of keypoints of the image.
    The image focus on the human body.
    The keypoints returned by the model is a list of keypoints of the image.
    Overall task is to create a visualization UI to allow users to upload images and visualize the keypoints.

  input_description: A single image used for keypoint detection needed to be converted to base64 format to upload to the model. 
  output_description: The keypoints of the image is a list of keypoints of the image. You need to connect the keypoints to the image.

  visualize:
    description: |
      The visualization of the image and the keypoints. Each data item includes:
      - The input image
      - The keypoints

    features:
      - list_display:
          description: Show a list of input data and their keypoints.
          fields:
            - input_image: The input image.
            - keypoints: The keypoints.
      - input_function:
          description: Allow users to enter new images for keypoint detection.
          steps:
            - Enter a list of images.
            - Display the keypoints.
