task_description:
  type: Image segmentation
  description: |
    Given an image, this task aims to segment the image into different classes.
    The model will return a segmented image.
    The segmented image returned by the model is a 2D array of the segmented image.
    Overall task is to create a visualization UI to allow users to upload images and visualize the segmented image.

  input_description: A single image used for segmentation needed to be converted to base64 format to upload to the model.
  output_description: The segmented image is a 2D array of the segmented image.

  visualize:
    description: |
      The visualization of the image and the segmented image. Each data item includes:
      - The input image
      - The segmented image
    features:
      - list_display:
          description: Show a list of input data and their segmented image.
          fields:
            - input_image: The input image.
            - segmented_image: The segmented image.
