task_description:
  type: Text classification
  description: |
    Given a text passage authored by a person, this task aims to identify the underlying emotion expressed in the text. 
    The model classifies the emotion into one of the following categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, or surprise. 
    The classification is based solely on the semantic and emotional cues present in the input text.
  input: |
    A single text passage written by an individual. The text may express an emotional state either explicitly (e.g., "I am so happy today!") or implicitly (e.g., "The sun finally came out after days of rain."). 
    The passage should be in natural language and may vary in length.

  output: |
    A single emotion label representing the primary emotion conveyed by the author in the text. 
    The possible labels are one of the following: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, or surprise.
