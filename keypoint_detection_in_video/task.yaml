task_description:
  type: Keypoint detection
  description: |
    Given a video, this task aims to detect the keypoints of the video.
    The model will return a video with the keypoints of the video.
    The video focus on the human body.
    The keypoints returned by the model is a list of keypoints of the video.
    Overall task is to create a visualization UI to allow users to upload videos and visualize the keypoints.
  input_description: A single video used for keypoint detection needed to be breaked into frames and converted to base64 format to upload the frames one by one to the model.
  output_description: With each frame, the model will return a list of keypoints of the frame.

  visualize:
    description: |
      The visualization of the video and the keypoints. Each data item includes:
      - The input video
      - The video with the keypoints

    features:
      - list_display:
          description: Show a list of input data and their keypoints.
          fields:
            - input_video: The input video.
            - keypoints: The keypoints.
      - input_function:
          description: Allow users to enter new videos for keypoint detection.
          steps:
            - Enter a list of videos.
            - Display the keypoints.
