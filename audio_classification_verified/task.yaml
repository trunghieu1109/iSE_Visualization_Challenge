  type: Audio Classification
  description: |
    This task focuses on detecting and classifying the emotional state of a speaker from an audio recording. 
    The system analyzes vocal cues—such as tone, pitch, intensity, and rhythm—to determine which emotion the speaker is expressing. 
    The goal is to categorize the audio into one of several predefined emotional labels (e.g., "sad", "happy", "angry", "neutral", "disgust", "fearful").
  input: |
    An audio clip containing a spoken utterance or vocal segment from a single speaker. 
    The recording should include clear vocal characteristics that reflect emotional expression. 
  output: |
    A single emotion label representing the predicted emotional state of the speaker. 
    The label is one of the following: "happy", "sad", "angry", "neutral", "disgust" or "fearful". 
    Optionally, a confidence score may be provided for each emotion to indicate prediction certainty.

      Display a list of input and corresponding output pairs. Each data item includes:
        - The audio clip containing a short speech from a speaker.
        - The emotion labels (e.g., "sad", "happy", "angry", "neutral", "disgust", "fearful") and their scores (probabilities).
        - An emoji corresponding to the predicted emotion.
